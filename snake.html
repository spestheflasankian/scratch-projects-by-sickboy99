<p> <div class="controls"> Left Arrow to turn left and Right arrow to turn right. Press spacebar to summon dancers and c to delete them. </div>This Snake game is made where you can try to trap and taunt the griffin (first part true but the griffin cant hear your taunts). Left and Right arrow keys to turn. Get the fortune cookie but 
at the cost of your long body. It can occasionally phase through your body when you manage to delete it so well. </p>
