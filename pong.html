 <p class="controls"> Left and Right arrow to move. </p>  <p> This game was created in my early scratch days, when I was creating a 2 player pong game. The ball physics is odd because the ball's bounce angle is random. With enough
  coding and some confusedness, I guess I could make it like the Atari Breakout (<a href="https://elgoog.im/breakout/">Click here to play</a>) but I'm too lazy. Go figure. 
  <br> Also, you can have some extra fun if you have a LEGO Mindstorms kit. First, connect it to scratch using <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/ev3">this guide</a> and plug in 2 touch sensors to 1 and 4 to play! <br>
Also, you simply cannot score a point against the enemy. I have coded it that even if you force it to run across the map, it will do so. Speed is no constraint for the boss.</p>
