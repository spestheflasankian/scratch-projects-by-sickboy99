   <p class="controls"> Arrow keys to move</p><p> This was made during one of the holiday challenges, where I suggested to learn how to make a scrolling game. This game occured as a result. Fun fact: I was not able to save it right for some weird reason. Anyway, I am a very inactive scratcher and will not be adding levels anytime soon. Feel free to play the existing levels though! <br><br> P.S. I totally did not add a konami code </p>
