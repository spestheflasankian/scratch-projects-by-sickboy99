<p> This is a project made for the AI component of Scratch. The car will learn to drive itself through the obstacle course. <div class="context"> The car can either start with the already-finished AI list or you can start again. However, it will take painstakingly long to finish it and if you choose to start again, I suggest that you Shift-Click green flag to allow the process to go on faster. </p>
