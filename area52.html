  <p>This game was made for the get and escape. I made the map such that it could increase the length of gameplay with minimal effort. The walls of the map are not completely straight so I suggest <strong> NOT </strong> clinging onto the walls. I suggest double-clicking to prevent the start orange key glitch.</p>
