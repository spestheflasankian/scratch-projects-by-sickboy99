  <p> This game was started when I was tasked to create a Solar System that is at the very least partially correct in terms of time. I decided to add a killer cat (one of my designs)
    as he was a logical choice to put in space. After that, I gave the planets the strength of a wrecking ball, enough to painfully murder the killer cat but call it a feature, call it bad 
    coding, the cat was able to move for a few more seconds while saying "<div class="quote">i died</div>" (see the below video), giving you sometimes enough time to win. </p>
