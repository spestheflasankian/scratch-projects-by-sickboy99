  <p class="controls"> Drag the turrets (as the name says) and change the slider values to change the angles of the turret. </p><p> This game was made when I experimented with the drag function. You can drag the turret, change the slider variables to change the angle it points at. Kill 100 circles to win
  and let 20 circles pass through to lose.</p>
